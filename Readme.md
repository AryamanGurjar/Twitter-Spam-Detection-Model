Deploy a machine learning model on the web, which can be used to test real-time data. 
For example: If you deploy a  spam detector model, they will collect relevant text data from Twitter using API and provide test results. The test will continue till the model receives the data. The outcomes of the test data can be displayed on the webpage with a scroll option (or stored in a file). 

How to run :

1. Run the python file spam.py.
2. Open the link in the terminal.
3. Type a hashtag, so that tweets which contain that hastag will be collected and click Predict button.
4. You will see the prediction on the screen.
